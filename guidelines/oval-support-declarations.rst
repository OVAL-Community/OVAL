SPAWAR Systems Center Atlantic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| *Declared February 25, 2010*
| *www.public.navy.mil/spawar/Atlantic/*
|
| The SCAP Compliance Checker has adopted OVAL as part of the FDCC Scanner capabilities of SCAP Validation Program. SCAP Compliance Checker is able to process all four of OVAL's schemas: the Definitions schema, the System Characteristics schema, the Results schema and the Variables schema. SCAP Compliance Checker processes the XCCDF content of a SCAP stream and extracts any variables that need to be imported into the OVAL engine. It then creates an XML file using the OVAL Variables schema that contains these variables. The OVAL engine later uses this file during OVAL processing. By using the industry standard OVAL schemas, SCAP Compliance Checker can share data with any tool that understands OVAL.

|
| SSA (Security System Analyzer) is free non-intrusive OVAL/XCCDF host-based security analyzer and compliance tool. It introduces a new simplified way to rely on open standards such OVAL and XCCDF to report compliance issues. SSA has adopted the OVAL standard as part of its vulnerability validation process. As a result, SSA consumes the Definitions and solely relies on the OVAL and XCCDF interpreters. vFeed provides a full aggregated, cross-linked and standardized Vulnerability Database based on CVE and standards such as OVAL, CPE, CWE, CAPEC, CVSS etc. Therefore, it introduces a new simplified XML format that expands the vulnerability coverage and correlation around the CVE. vFeed has adopted the OVAL as part of its correlation and aggregation capability. As a result, vFeed consumes the OVAL XML definitions, extract and map variables to expand the CVEs data.
