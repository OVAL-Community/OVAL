Create an Issue
===============

An issue can be described as any bug, discussion, new language feature, or update to an existing language feature, which may hold relevance within the OVAL community.  When creating an issue within GitHub, a number of potential labels may be applied, based on the context of the issue.

Labels
-----------

* **Discussion**: A discussion is meant for general OVAL-related threads.  These discussion may reflect implementation details, software updates, and/or suggestions for the OVAL community at large.
* **Question**: An issue labeled "question" should have the intent of being an item which requires resolution by the OVAL community.  These issues may consist of implementation-related questions, OVAL language governance-related questions, requests for specific information regarding new schema objects, etc.
* **Bug**: An issue labeled "Bug" represents a technical or implementation-related issue with an OVAL schema or specific construct within a schema.  A bug could illustrate to  implementers the flaws in a proposed OVAL construct, for example.
* **Website-Documentation**: An issue labeled "Website Documentation" represents a distinct category of "Bug", specific to "front-facing" OVAL documentation.  If process documents require updating, such as how to create an issue, the flaws in those documents should be noted as "website documentation" issues.
* **OVAL-Documentation**:  An issue labeled "OVAL Documentation" represents a distinct category of "Bug", specific to the OVAL Schema documentation.  For example, a Test, Object, or State definition contains inadequate explanation, or typo's exist in an element's name or description.
* **Existing-Schema-Update**: This issue label is intended to document a proposed update to an already existing OVAL schema.  If a contributor would like to add to or remove elements or behaviors from the Unix "file_test" (for example), that proposal would receive this label.
* **Add-to-Existing-Schema**: This issue label is intended to document a proposed addition to an already existing OVAL schema.  A new Microsoft Windows Test/Object/State would be an example of an issue assigned this label. 
* **New Schema**: This issue label is intended for those proposals which represent previously non-existing OVAL platform coverage.  Perhaps a contributor proposes OVAL language enhancements for Docker, or one of the many cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

How To
------

Creating an issue is very straightforward.  Simply navigate a web browser to `the OVAL Community <https://github.com/OVAL-Community/OVAL/issues>`_ and click the "New Issue" button.  At this point, the issue creator has options.  A number of issue templates exist to assist contributors:

* **Proposal**: This template allows contributors to easily propose additions or changes to the OVAL language.
* **Alternate Proposal**: This template allows contributors to offer an alternative to an existing proposal.
* **Objection**: This template allows contributors to object to, or raise issues regarding an existing proposal.
* **Bug**:  This template allows contributors to log an issue with existing OVAL language elements.

Clicking the "Get started" button adjacent to the issue template navigates the user to a pre-filled issue.  The contributor may then "fill in the blanks" in the issue template to create the specific ticket.

If none of the issue templates are applicable to the type of issue being created, the contributor can click the "Open a regular issue" link.  Add an appropriate title and issue information, describing the issue or question as clearly and succinctly as possible.  Select the appropriate issue label(s) by clicking the small "gear" icon adjacent to the "Labels" indicator on the right-hand-side of the page, and submit the issue to the community by clicking the "Submit new issue" button.

* Unsure of the label to choose?  Select the label(s) which are most relevant to the issue being created.  If changes are necessary, the community moderator(s) will adjust the label accordingly.
