Welcome to The OVAL Community Guidelines!
=========================================

Welcome to the guidelines for OVAL, the Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language. These guidelines are designed to explain everything you need to know to start contributing to OVAL (or link you to places to ask questions, should the explanations not suffice), as well as provide a variety of standards and resources to the community.

What is OVAL?
-------------

OVAL is an open language built by security experts, system administrators, and software developers to universalize assessment and reporting on the state of computer systems.

Who is the OVAL Community?
--------------------------

The `OVAL Community <http://oval-community-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community-organization/index.html>`_ is the group responsible for proposals about anything and everything OVAL related. It comprises `general members <https://oval-community-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community-organization/community-members.html>`_, `Area Supervisors <https://oval-community-guidelines.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community-organization/area-supervisors.html>`_, the `Leadership Board <https://oval.cisecurity.org/community/board_members>`_, and the `Sponsor <https://www.cisecurity.org/>`_. The community maintains, fixes, and improves OVAL through an established governance process.
