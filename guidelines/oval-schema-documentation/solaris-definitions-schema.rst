Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: Solaris Definition  
=========================================================
* Schema: Solaris Definition  
* Version: 5.11.1:1.1  
* Release Date: 11/30/2016 09:00:00 AM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the Solaris specific tests found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each test is an extension of the standard test element defined in the Core Definition Schema. Through extension, each test inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL tests. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at http://oval.cisecurity.org.

.. _facet_test:  
  
< facet_test >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The facet_test is used to check the facets associated with the specified Image Packaging System image. Facets are properties that control whether or not optional components from a package are installed on a system. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references an facet_object and the optional state elements reference a facet_state and specifies the data to check.

---------------------------------------------------------
The isainfo test reveals information about the instruction set architectures. This information can be retrieved by the isainfo command. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references an isainfo_object and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

There is actually only one object relating to isainfo and this is the system as a whole. Therefore, there are no child entities defined. Any OVAL Test written to check isainfo will reference the same isainfo_object which is basically an empty object element.

The maximum length is 256 ASCII characters and the first character cannot be a left parenthesis. Current Solaris software practice is to assign this parameter monotonically increasing Dewey decimal values of the form: major_revision.minor_revision[.micro_revision] where all the revision fields are integers. The versioning fields can be extended to an arbitrary string of numbers in Dewey-decimal format, if necessary.

      - 'supersedence' specifies that the object should also match any superseding patches to the one being specified. In Solaris, a patch can be superseded in two ways. The first way is implicitly when a new revision of a patch is released (e.g. patch 12345-02 supersedes patch 12345-01). The second way is explicitly where a new patch contains the complete functionality of another patch. If set to 'true', the resulting object set would be the original patch specified plus any superseding patches. The default value is 'false' meaning the object should only match the specified patch.
