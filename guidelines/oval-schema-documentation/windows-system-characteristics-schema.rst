Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: Windows System Characteristics  
=========================================================
* Schema: Windows System Characteristics  
* Version: 5.11.1:1.4  
* Release Date: 01/09/2017 10:00:00 PM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the Windows specific system characteristic items found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each item is an extension of the standard item element defined in the Core System Characteristic Schema. Through extension, each item inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL Items. Each item is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core System Characteristic Schema is not outlined here.

The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at http://oval.cisecurity.org.

.. _accesstoken_item:  
  
< accesstoken_item > (Deprecated)  
---------------------------------------------------------
**Deprecation Info**:  
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.11  
* Reason: Replaced by the userright_item. The accesstoken_test suffers from scalability issues when run on a domain controller and should not be used. See the userright_item.  
* Comment: This object has been deprecated and may be removed in a future version of the language.  
  
The access token item holds information about the individual privileges and rights associated with a specific access token. It is important to note that these privileges are specific to certain versions of Windows. As a result, the documentation for that version of Windows should be consulted for more information. Each privilege and right in the data section accepts a boolean value signifying whether the privilege is granted or not. It extends the standard ItemType as defined in the oval-system-characteristics schema and one should refer to the ItemType description for more information.

Child Elements  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table:: Elements  
    :header-rows: 1  
  
    * - Child Elements  
      - Type (MinOccurs..MaxOccurs)  
      - Desc.  
    * - security_principle  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - Security principles include users or groups with either local or domain accounts, and computer accounts created when a computer joins a domain. In Windows, security principles are case-insensitive. As a result, it is recommended that the case-insensitive operations are used for this entity. User rights and permissions to access objects such as Active Directory objects, files, and registry settings are assigned to security principles. In a domain environment, security principles should be identified in the form: "domain\trustee name". For local security principles use: "computer name\trustee name". For built-in accounts on the system, use the trustee name without a domain.  
    * - seassignprimarytokenprivilege  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemBoolType (0..1)  
      - If this privilege is enabled, it allows a parent process to replace the access token that is associated with a child process.

< activedirectory_item > (Deprecated)  
---------------------------------------------------------
**Deprecation Info**:  
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.11.1:1.2  
* Reason: Use the original activedirectory_item. The activedirectory57_test suffers from ambiguity; it was never adequately specified, and it does not even seem possible to have structured data in the context of the enumerated AdstypeTypes. Use the original activedirectory_test instead.  
* Comment: This object has been deprecated and may be removed in a future version of the language.  
  
The active directory item holds information about specific entries in the Windows Active Directory. It extends the standard ItemType as defined in the oval-system-characteristics schema and one should refer to the ItemType description for more information.

Note that this ite supports only simple (string based) value collection. For more complex values see the activedirectory57_item.

      - The actual value of the specified Active Directory attribute. Note that while an Active Directory attribute can contain structured data where it is necessary to collect multiple related fields that can be described by the 'record' datatype, it is not always the case. It also is possible that an Active Directory attribute can contain only a single value or an array of values. In these cases, there is not a name to uniquely identify the corresponding field(s) which is a requirement for fields in the 'record' datatype. As a result, the name of the Active Directory attribute will be used to uniquely identify the field(s) and satisfy this requirement. If the Active Directory attribute contains a single value, the 'record' will have a single field identified by the name of the Active Directory attribute. If the Active Directory attribute contains an array of values, the 'record' will have multiple fields all identified by the name of the Active Directory attribute

< auditeventpolicysubcategories_item >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The auditeventpolicysubcategories_item is used to hold information about the audit event policy settings on a Windows system. These settings are used to specify which system and network events are monitored. For example, if the credential_validation element has a value of AUDIT_FAILURE, it means that the system is configured to log all unsuccessful attempts to validate a user account on a system. It is important to note that these audit event policy settings are specific to certain versions of Windows. As a result, the documentation for that version of Windows should be consulted for more information on each setting. It extends the standard ItemType as defined in the oval-system-characteristics schema and one should refer to the ItemType description for more information.

---------------------------------------------------------
**Deprecation Info**:  
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.11  
* Reason: Replaced by the group_sid_item. This item uses trustee names for identifying accounts on the system.  Trustee names are not unique and the group_sid_item, which uses trustee SIDs which are unique, should be used instead. See the group_sid_item.  
* Comment: This object has been deprecated and may be removed in a future version of the language.  
  
The Windows group_item allows the different users and subgroups, that directly belong to specific groups (identified by name), to be collected. The collected subgroups will not be resolved to find indirect user or subgroup members. If the subgroups need to be resolved, it should be done using the sid_object. Note that the user and subgroup elements can appear an unlimited number of times. If a user is not found in the specified group, a single user element should exist with a status of 'does not exist'. If there is an error determining the users of a group, a single user element should exist with a status of 'error'. If a subgroup is not found in the specified group, a single subgroup element should exist with a status of 'does not exist'. If there is an error determining the subgroups of a group, a single subgroup element should exist with a status of 'error'.

If the specified registry key is of type REG_BINARY, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'binary' and the data represented by the value entity should follow the xsd:hexBinary form. (each binary octet is encoded as two hex digits) If the registry key is of type REG_DWORD or REG_QWORD, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'int' and the value entity should represent the data as an integer. If the specified registry key is of type REG_EXPAND_SZ, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'string' and the pre-expanded string should be represented by the value entity. If the specified registry key is of type REG_MULTI_SZ, then multiple value entities should exist to describe the array of strings, with each value element holds a single string. In the end, there should be the same number of value entities as there are strings in the reg_multi_sz array. If the specified registry key is of type REG_SZ, then the datatype should be 'string' and the value entity should be a copy of the string.

.. _passwordpolicy_item:  
  
< passwordpolicy_item >  
---------------------------------------------------------
Specific policy items associated with passwords. It is important to note that these policies are specific to certain versions of Windows. As a result, the documentation for that version of Windows should be consulted for more information. Information is stored in the SAM or Active Directory but is encrypted or hidden so the registry_item and activedirectory_item are of no use. If this can be figured out, then the password_policy item is not needed.

      - The hive that the registry key belongs to.  
    * - key  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - This element describes a registry key to be gathered. Note that the hive portion of the string should not be included, as this data can be found under the hive element. If the xsi:nil attribute is set to true, then the item being represented is the higher level hive or lower level name. Using xsi:nil here will result in a status of 'not collected' for this entity since the item is specific to a hive or name.  
    * - name  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - This element describes the name of a registry key. If the xsi:nil attribute is set to true, then the item being represented is the higher level key or hive. Using xsi:nil here will result in a status of 'not collected' since the item is specific to a key or hive.  
    * - last_write_time  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemIntType (0..1)  
      - The last time that the key or any of its value entries were modified. The value of this entity represents the FILETIME structure which is a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 (UTC). Last write time can be queried on any key, with hives being classified as a type of key. When collecting only information about a registry hive or key the last write time will be the time the key or any of its entries were modified. When collecting only information about a registry name the last write time will be the time the containing key was modified. Thus when collecting information about a registry name, the last write time does not correlate directly to the specified name. See the RegQueryInfoKey function lpftLastWriteTime.  
    * - type  
      - win-sc:EntityItemRegistryTypeType (0..1)  
      - Specifies the type of data stored by the registry key. Please refer to the EntityItemRegistryTypeType for more information about the different possible types.  
    * - value  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemAnySimpleType (0..unbounded)  
      - The value entity holds the actual value of the specified registry key. The representation of the value as well as the associated datatype attribute depends on type of data stored in the registry key. If the value being tested is of type REG_BINARY, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'binary' and the data represented by the value entity should follow the xsd:hexBinary form. (each binary octet is encoded as two hex digits) If the value being tested is of type REG_DWORD, REG_QWORD, REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN, REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, or REG_QWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN then the datatype attribute should be set to 'int' and the value entity should represent the data as an unsigned integer. DWORD and QWORD values represnt unsigned 32-bit and 64-bit integers, respectively. If the value being tested is of type REG_EXPAND_SZ, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'string' and the pre-expanded string should be represented by the value entity. If the value being tested is of type REG_MULTI_SZ, then only a single string (one of the multiple strings) should be tested using the value entity with the datatype attribute set to 'string'. In order to test multiple values, multiple OVAL registry tests or multiple states should be combined. Reg_multi_sz values, with no values, should be given a status of "does not exist". If the specified registry key is of type REG_SZ, then the datatype should be 'string' and the value entity should be a copy of the string. If the value being tested is of type REG_LINK, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'string' and the null-terminated Unicode string should be represented by the value entity.  
    * - expanded_value  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemAnySimpleType (0..1)  
      - For registry values of type REG_EXPAND_SZ, this entity contains the expanded value. Otherwise, it should not exist.  
    * - windows_view  
      - win-sc:EntityItemWindowsViewType (0..1)  
      - The windows view value from which this OVAL Item was collected. This is used to indicate from which view (32-bit or 64-bit), the associated Item was collected. A value of '32_bit' indicates the Item was collected from the 32-bit view. A value of '64-bit' indicates the Item was collected from the 64-bit view. Omitting this entity removes any assertion about which view the Item was collected from, and therefore it is strongly suggested that this entity be set.

      - The windows view value from which this OVAL Item was collected. This is used to indicate from which view (32-bit or 64-bit), the associated Item was collected. A value of '32_bit' indicates the Item was collected from the 32-bit view. A value of '64-bit' indicates the Item was collected from the 64-bit view. Omitting this entity removes any assertion about which view the Item was collected from, and therefore it is strongly suggested that this entity be set.

      - | A file that is a sparse file.  
    * - FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM  
      - | A file or directory that the operating system uses a part of, or uses exclusively.  
    * - FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY  
      - | A file that is being used for temporary storage. File systems avoid writing data back to mass storage if sufficient cache memory is available, because typically, an application deletes a temporary file after the handle is closed. In that scenario, the system can entirely avoid writing the data. Otherwise, the data is written after the handle is closed.  
    * - FILE_ATTRIBUTE_VIRTUAL  
      - | This value is reserved for system use.

.. _EntityItemSharedResourceTypeType:  
  
== EntityItemSharedResourceTypeType ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
The EntityItemSharedResourceTypeType complex type defines the different values that are valid for the type entity of a shared resource item. Note that the Windows API returns a DWORD value and OVAL uses the constant name that is normally defined for these return values. This is done to increase readability and maintainability of OVAL Definitions. The empty string is also allowed to support empty elements associated with error conditions.

It is also important to note that special shared resources are those reserved for remote administration, interprocess communication, and administrative shares.
