Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: Windows Definition  
=========================================================
* Schema: Windows Definition  
* Version: 5.11.1:1.4  
* Release Date: 01/09/2017 10:00:00 PM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the Windows specific tests found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each test is an extension of the standard test element defined in the Core Definition Schema. Through extension, each test inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL tests. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at http://oval.cisecurity.org.

< accesstoken_test > (Deprecated)  
---------------------------------------------------------
Deprecation Info  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.11  
* Reason: Replaced by the userright_test. This accesstoken_test suffers from scalability issues when run on a domain controller and should not be used. See the userright_test.  
* Comment: This test has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.  
  
The accesstoken_test is used to check the properties of a Windows access token as well as individual privileges and rights associated with it. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references an accesstoken_object and the optional state element specifies the data to check.

**Extends:** oval-def:TestType

* Deprecated As Of Version 5.11  
* Reason: Replaced by the userright_object. The accesstoken_test suffers from scalability issues when run on a domain controller and should not be used. See the userright_object.  
* Comment: This object has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.  
  
The accesstoken_object element is used by an access token test to define the object to be evaluated. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

An accesstoken_object consists of a single security principle that identifies user, group, or computer account that is associated with the token.

      - The security_principle element defines the access token being specified. Security principles include users or groups with either local or domain accounts, and computer accounts created when a computer joins a domain. In Windows, security principles are case-insensitive. As a result, it is recommended that the case-insensitive operations are used for this entity. User rights and permissions to access objects such as Active Directory objects, files, and registry settings are assigned to security principles. In a domain environment, security principles should be identified in the form: "domain\trustee name". For local security principles use: "computer name\trustee name". For built-in accounts on the system, use the trustee name without a domain. If an operation other than equals is used to identify matching trustees (i.e. not equal, or a pattern match) then the resulting matches shall be limited to only the trustees referenced in the Local Security Authority database. The scope is limited here to avoid unnecessarily resource intensive searches for trustees. Note that the larger scope of all known trustees may be obtained through the use of variables.

* Comment: This state has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.  
  
The accesstoken_state element defines the different information that can be used to evaluate the specified access tokens. This includes the multitude of user rights and permissions that can be granted. Please refer to the individual elements in the schema for more details about what each represents.

.. _AccesstokenBehaviors:  
  
== AccesstokenBehaviors == (Deprecated)  
---------------------------------------------------------
Deprecation Info  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.11  
* Reason: Replaced by the userright_test. The AccesstokenBehaviors complex type is used by the accesstoken_test which suffers from scalability issues when run on a domain controller and should not be used. As a result, the AccesstokenBehaviors complex type is no longer needed. See the userright_test.  
* Comment: This complex type has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.  
  
The AccesstokenBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the accesstoken_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

      - Desc.  
    * - include_group (Deprecated)  
      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='true')  
      - If a group security principle is specified, this behavior specifies whether to include the group or not. For example, maybe you want to check the access tokens associated with every user within a group, but not the group itself. In this case, you would set the include_group behavior to 'false'. If the security_principle is not a group, then this behavior should be ignored.  
    * - resolve_group (Deprecated)  
      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='false')  
      - The 'resolve_group' behavior defines whether an object set defined by a group SID should be resolved to return a set that contains all the user SIDs that are a member of that group. Note that all child groups should also be resolved and any valid domain users that are members of the group should also be included. The intent of this behavior is to end up with a list of all individual users from that system that make up the group once everything has been resolved.

The activedirectory_object element is used by an active directory test to define those objects to evaluated based on a specified state. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

An active directory object consists of three pieces of information, a naming context, a relative distinguished name, and an attribute. Each piece helps identify a specific active directory entry.

    * - naming_context  
      - win-def:EntityObjectNamingContextType (1..1)  
      - Each object in active directory exists under a certain naming context (also known as a partition). A naming context is defined as a single object in the Directory Information Tree (DIT) along with every object in the tree subordinate to it. There are three default naming contexts in Active Directory: domain, configuration, and schema.  
    * - relative_dn  
      - oval-def:EntityObjectStringType (1..1)  
      - The relative_dn field is used to uniquely identify an object inside the specified naming context. It contains all the parts of the object's distinguished name except those outlined by the naming context. If the xsi:nil attribute is set to true, then the object being specified is the higher level naming context. In this case, the relative_dn element should not be collected or used in analysis. Setting xsi:nil equal to true is different than using a .* pattern match, which says to collect every relative dn under a given naming context.  
    * - attribute  
      - oval-def:EntityObjectStringType (1..1)  
      - Specifies a named value contained by the object. If the xsi:nil attribute is set to true, the attribute element should not be collected or used in analysis. Setting xsi:nil equal to true is different than using a .* pattern match, which says to collect every attribute under a given relative dn.  
  
.. _activedirectory_state:  
  
< activedirectory_state >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The activedirectory_state element defines the different information that can be used to evaluate the specified entries in active directory. An active directory test will reference a specific instance of this state that defines the exact settings that need to be evaluated. Please refer to the individual elements in the schema for more details about what each represents.

The active directory test is used to check information about specific entries in active directory. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references an activedirectory57_object and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

Note that this test supports complex values that are in the form of a record. For simple (string based) value collection see the activedirectory_test.

The activedirectory57_object element is used by an active directory test to define those objects to evaluated based on a specified state. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

An active directory object consists of three pieces of information, a naming context, a relative distinguished name, and an attribute. Each piece helps identify a specific active directory entry.

Note that this object supports complex values that are in the form of a record. For simple (string based) value collection see the activedirectory_object.

It also is possible that an Active Directory attribute can contain only a single value or an array of values. In these cases, there is not a name to uniquely identify the corresponding field which is a requirement for fields in the 'record' datatype. As a result, the name of the Active Directory attribute will be used to uniquely identify the field and satisfy this requirement.

The auditeventpolicysubcategories_test is used to check the audit event policy settings on a Windows system. These settings are used to specify which system and network events are monitored. For example, if the credential_validation element has a value of AUDIT_FAILURE, it means that the system is configured to log all unsuccessful attempts to validate a user account on a system. It is important to note that these audit event policy settings are specific to certain versions of Windows. As a result, the documentation for that version of Windows should be consulted for more information on each setting. The test extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information.

< cmdlet_object >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The cmdlet_object element is used by a cmdlet_test to identify the set of cmdlets to use and the parameters to provide to them for checking the state of a system. In order to ensure the consistency of PowerShell cmdlet support among OVAL interpreters as well as ensure that the state of a system is not changed, every OVAL interpreter must implement the following requirements. An OVAL interpreter must only support the processing of the verbs specified in the EntityObjectCmdletVerbType. If a cmdlet verb that is not defined in this enumeration is discovered, an error should be reported and the cmdlet must not be executed on the system. While XML Schema validation will enforce this requirement, it is strongly recommended that OVAL interpreters implement a whitelist of allowed cmdlets. This can be done using constrained runspaces which can limit the PowerShell execution environment. For more information, please see Microsoft's documentation on Windows PowerShell Host Application Concepts. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that OVAL interpreters also implement PowerShell support with the NoLanguage mode enabled. The NoLanguage mode ensures that scripts that need to be evaluated are not allowed in the runspace. For more information about the NoLanguage mode, please see Microsoft's documentation on the PSLanguageMode enumeration.

.. _file_object:  
  
< file_object >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The file_object element is used by a file test to define the specific file(s) to be evaluated. The file_object will collect directories and all Windows file types (FILE_TYPE_CHAR, FILE_TYPE_DISK, FILE_TYPE_PIPE, FILE_TYPE_REMOTE, and FILE_TYPE_UNKNOWN). Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

A file object defines the path and filename or complete filepath of the file(s). In addition, a number of behaviors may be provided that help guide the collection of objects. Please refer to the FileBehaviors complex type for more information about specific behaviors.

The set of files to be evaluated may be identified with either a complete filepath or a path and filename. Only one of these options may be selected.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

For example, one would set xsi:nil to true if the desire was to test the attributes or permissions associated with a directory. Setting xsi:nil equal to true is different than using a .* pattern match, which says to collect every file under a given path.

.. _FileBehaviors:  
  
== FileBehaviors ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
The FileBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the file_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

Attributes  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    :header-rows: 1  
  
    * - Attribute  
      - Type  
      - Desc.  
    * - max_depth  
      - Restriction of xsd:integer (optional *default*='-1')  
      - 'max_depth' defines the maximum depth of recursion to perform when a recurse_direction is specified. A value of '0' is equivalent to no recursion, '1' means to step only one directory level up/down, and so on. The default value is '-1' meaning no limitation. For a 'max_depth' of -1 or any value of 1 or more the starting directory must be considered in the recursive search.  
Note that the default recurse_direction behavior is 'none' so even though max_depth specifies no limitation by default, the recurse_direction behavior turns recursion off.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
    * - recurse  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='directories') ('directories', 'junctions', 'junctions and directories')  
      - 'recurse' defines how to recurse into the path entity, in other words what to follow during recursion. Options include junctions, directories, or both (a junction on Windows is equivalent to a symlink on Unix). Note that a max-depth other than 0 has to be specified for recursion to take place and for this attribute to mean anything.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
    * - recurse_direction  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='none') ('none', 'up', 'down')  
      - 'recurse_direction' defines the direction, either 'up' to parent directories, or 'down' into child directories to recursively search for files. When recursing up or down, one is limited by the max_depth behavior. Note that it is not an error if max_depth specifies a certain level of recursion and that level does not exist. Recursing should only go as deep as available. The default value is 'none' for no recursion.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
    * - recurse_file_system  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='all') ('all', 'local', 'defined')  
      - 'recurse_file_system' defines the file system limitation of any searching and applies to all operations as specified on the path or filepath entity. The value of 'local' limits the search scope to local file systems (as opposed to file systems mounted from an external system). The value of 'defined' keeps any recursion within the file system that the file_object (path+filename or filepath) has specified. For example, if the path specified was "C:\", you would search only the C: drive, not other filesystems mounted to descendant paths. The value of 'defined' only applies when an equality operation is used for searching because the path or filepath entity must explicitly define a file system. The default value is 'all' meaning to search all available file systems for data collection.  
Note that in most cases it is recommended that the value of 'local' be used to ensure that file system searching is limited to only the local file systems. Searching 'all' file systems may have performance implications.  
    * - windows_view  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='64_bit') ('32_bit', '64_bit')  
      - 64-bit versions of Windows provide an alternate file system and registry views to 32-bit applications. This behavior allows the OVAL Object to state which view should be examined. This behavior only applies to 64-bit Windows, and must not be applied on other platforms.  
Note that the values have the following meaning: '64_bit' - Indicates that the 64-bit view on 64-bit Windows operating systems must be examined. On a 32-bit system, the Object must be evaluated without applying the behavior. '32_bit' - Indicates that the 32-bit view must be examined. On a 32-bit system, the Object must be evaluated without applying the behavior. It is recommended that the corresponding 'windows_view' entity be set on the OVAL Items that are collected when this behavior is used to distinguish between OVAL Items that were collected in the 32-bit or 64-bit views.

The file audit permissions test is used to check the audit permissions associated with Windows files. Note that the trustee's audited permissions are the audit permissons that the SACL grants to the trustee or to any groups of which the trustee is a member. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information.

< fileauditedpermissions53_object >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The fileauditedpermissions53_object element is used by a file audited permissions test to define the objects used to evalutate against the specified state. The fileauditedpermissions53_object will collect directories and all Windows file types (FILE_TYPE_CHAR, FILE_TYPE_DISK, FILE_TYPE_PIPE, FILE_TYPE_REMOTE, and FILE_TYPE_UNKNOWN). Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic.

A fileauditedpermissions53_object is defined as a combination of a Windows file and trustee SID. The file represents the file to be evaluated while the trustee SID represents the account (SID) to check audited permissions of. If multiple files or SIDs are matched by either reference, then each possible combination of file and SID is a matching file audited permissions object. In addition, a number of behaviors may be provided that help guide the collection of objects. Please refer to the FileAuditPermissions53Behaviors complex type for more information about specific behaviors.

The set of files to be evaluated may be identified with either a complete filepath or a path and filename. Only one of these options may be selected.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

---------------------------------------------------------
Deprecation Info  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.3  
* Reason: Replaced by the FileAuditPermissionsBehaviors53. The FileAuditPermissionsBehaviors complex type is used by the fileauditedpermissions_test which uses a trustee_name element for identifying trustees. Trustee names are not unique, and a new test was created to use trustee SIDs, which are unique. This new test utilizes the FileAuditPermissionsBehaviors53 complex type, and as a result, the FileAuditPermissionsBehaviors complex type is no longer needed.  
* Comment: This complex type has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.  
  
The FileAuditPermissionsBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the fileauditpermissions_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

The FileAuditPermissionsBehaviors extend the win-def:FileBehaviors and therefore include the behaviors defined by that type.

Note that all child groups should also be resolved any valid domain users that are members of the group should also be included. The intent of this behavior is to end up with a list of all individual users from that system that make up the group once everything has been resolved.

< fileeffectiverights53_object >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The fileeffectiverights53_object element is used by a file effective rights test to define the objects used to evalutate against the specified state. The fileeffectiverights53_object will collect directories and all Windows file types (FILE_TYPE_CHAR, FILE_TYPE_DISK, FILE_TYPE_PIPE, FILE_TYPE_REMOTE, and FILE_TYPE_UNKNOWN). Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic.

A fileeffectiverights53_object is defined as a combination of a Windows file and trustee SID. The file represents the file to be evaluated while the trustee SID represents the account (SID) to check effective rights of. If multiple files or SIDs are matched by either reference, then each possible combination of file and SID is a matching file effective rights object. In addition, a number of behaviors may be provided that help guide the collection of objects. Please refer to the FileEffectiveRights53Behaviors complex type for more information about specific behaviors.

The set of files to be evaluated may be identified with either a complete filepath or a path and filename. Only one of these options may be selected.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

In this case, the filename element should not be used during collection and would result in the unique set of items being the directories themselves. For example, one would set xsi:nil to true if the desire was to test the attributes or permissions associated with a directory. Setting xsi:nil equal to true is different than using a .* pattern match, which says to collect every file under a given path..

If an operation other than equals is used to identify matching trustees (i.e. not equal, or a pattern match) then the resulting matches shall be limited to only the trustees referenced in the file's Security Descriptor. The scope is limited here to avoid unnecessarily resource intensive searches for trustees. Note that the larger scope of all known trustees may be obtained through the use of variables.

.. _FileEffectiveRightsBehaviors:  
  
== FileEffectiveRightsBehaviors == (Deprecated)  
---------------------------------------------------------
Deprecation Info  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.3  
* Reason: Replaced by the FileEffectiveRightsBehaviors53. The FileEffectiveRightsBehaviors complex type is used by the fileeffectiverights_test which uses a trustee_name element for identifying trustees. Trustee names are not unique, and a new test was created to use trustee SIDs, which are unique. This new test utilizes the FileEffectiveRightsBehaviors53 complex type, and as a result, the FileEffectiveRightsBehaviors complex type is no longer needed.  
* Comment: This complex type has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.  
  
The FileEffectiveRightsBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the fileeffectiverights_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

The FileEffectiveRightsBehaviors extend the win-def:FileBehaviors and therefore include the behaviors defined by that type.

      - 'include_group' defines whether the group trustee name should be included in the object when the object is defined by a group trustee name. For example, the intent of an object defined by a group SID might be to retrieve all the user trustee names that are members of the group, but not the group trustee name itself.  
    * - resolve_group (Deprecated)  
      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='false')  
      - The 'resolve_group' behavior defines whether an object set defined by a group SID should be resolved to return a set that contains all the user SIDs that are a member of that group. Note that all child groups should also be resolved any valid domain users that are members of the group should also be included. The intent of this behavior is to end up with a list of all individual users from that system that make up the group once everything has been resolved.

The group_test allows the different users and subgroups, that directly belong to specific groups (identified by name), to be tested. When the group_test collects the groups on the system, it should only include the local and built-in group accounts and not domain group accounts. However, it is important to note that domain group accounts can still be looked up. Also, note that the subgroups of the group will not be resolved to find indirect user and group members. If the subgroups need to be resolved, it should be done using the sid_object. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information.

A junction_object consists of a path entity that contains the path to a symbolic link file. The resulting item identifies the canonical path of the link target (followed to its final destination, if there are intermediate links), an error if the link target does not exist or is a circular link (e.g., a link to itself). If the directory located at path is not a junction, or if there is no directory located at the path, then any resulting item would itself have a status of does not exist.

    * - value  
      - oval-def:EntityStateAnySimpleType (0..1)  
      - The value entity allows a test to be written against the value held within the specified license entry(-ies). If the value being tested is of type REG_BINARY, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'binary' and the data represented by the value entity should follow the xsd:hexBinary form. (each binary octet is encoded as two hex digits) If the value being tested is of type REG_DWORD, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'int' and the value entity should represent the data as an integer. If the specified registry key is of type REG_SZ, then the datatype should be 'string' and the value entity should be a copy of the string.Note that if the intent is to test a version number held in the license entry (as a reg_sz) then instead of setting the datatype to 'string', the datatype can be set to 'version'. This allows tools performing the evaluation to know how to perform less than and greater than operations correctly.

The value of this entity represents the FILETIME structure which is a 64-bit value representing the number of 100-nanosecond intervals since January 1, 1601 (UTC). Last write time can be queried on a key or name. When collecting only information about a registry key the last write time will be the time the key or any of its entiries was written to. When collecting only information about a registry name the last write time will be the time the name was written to. See the RegQueryInfoKey function lpftLastWriteTime.  
    * - type

    * - value  
      - oval-def:EntityStateAnySimpleType (0..1)  
      - The value entity allows a test to be written against the value held within the specified registry key(s). If the value being tested is of type REG_BINARY, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'binary' and the data represented by the value entity should follow the xsd:hexBinary form. (each binary octet is encoded as two hex digits) If the value being tested is of type REG_DWORD or REG_QWORD, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'int' and the value entity should represent the data as an integer. If the value being tested is of type REG_EXPAND_SZ, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'string' and the pre-expanded string should be represented by the value entity. If the value being tested is of type REG_MULTI_SZ, then only a single string (one of the multiple strings) should be tested using the value entity with the datatype attribute set to 'string'. In order to test multiple values, multiple OVAL registry tests should be used. If the specified registry key is of type REG_SZ, then the datatype should be 'string' and the value entity should be a copy of the string.Note that if the intent is to test a version number held in the registry (as a reg_sz) then instead of setting the datatype to 'string', the datatype can be set to 'version'. This allows tools performing the evaluation to know how to perform less than and greater than operations correctly.  
  
.. _NTUserBehaviors:  
  
== NTUserBehaviors ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
The NTUserBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the ntuser_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

      - Desc.  
    * - include_default  
      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='false')  
      - 'include_default' defines if the Window's local Default ntuser.dat file is included in the results. By default, this file is not included in the results.  
The Default User's directory which contains the ntuser.dat file is stored in the registry at 'HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SOFTWARE/Microsoft/Windows NT/CurrentVersion/ProfileList/Default'.  
    * - max_depth  
      - Restriction of xsd:integer (optional *default*='-1')  
      - 'max_depth' defines the maximum depth of recursion to perform when a recurse_direction is specified. A value of '0' is equivalent to no recursion, '1' means to step only one directory level up/down, and so on. The default value is '-1' meaning no limitation. For a 'max_depth' of -1 or any value of 1 or more the starting key must be considered in the recursive search.  
Note that the default recurse_direction behavior is 'none' so even though max_depth specifies no limitation by default, the recurse_direction behavior turns recursion off.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the key entity.  
    * - recurse_direction  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='none') ('none', 'up', 'down')  
      - 'recurse_direction' defines the direction, either 'up' to parent keys, or 'down' into child keys to recursively search for registry keys. When recursing up or down, one is limited by the max_depth behavior. Note that it is not an error if max_depth specifies a certain level of recursion and that level does not exist. Recursing should only go as deep as available. The default value is 'none' for no recursion.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the key entity.  
    * - windows_view  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='64_bit') ('32_bit', '64_bit')  
      - 64-bit versions of Windows provide an alternate file system and registry views to 32-bit applications. This behavior allows the OVAL Object to specify which view should be examined. This behavior only applies to 64-bit Windows, and must not be applied on other platforms.  
Note that the values have the following meaning: '64_bit' – Indicates that the 64-bit view on 64-bit Windows operating systems must be examined. On a 32-bit system, the Object must be evaluated without applying the behavior. '32_bit' – Indicates that the 32-bit view must be examined. On a 32-bit system, the Object must be evaluated without applying the behavior. It is recommended that the corresponding 'windows_view' entity be set on the OVAL Items that are collected when this behavior is used to distinguish between the OVAL Items that are collected in the 32-bit or 64-bit views.

It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a passwordpolicy_object and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

NOTE: This information is stored in the SAM or Active Directory but is encrypted or hidden so the registry_test and activedirectory57_test are of no use. If this can be figured out, then the password_policy test is not needed.

The peheader_object is used by a peheader_test to define the specific file(s) whose headers should be evaluated. The peheader_object will collect header information from PE files. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

A peheader_object defines the path and filename or complete filepath of the file(s). In addition, a number of behaviors may be provided that help guide the collection of objects. Please refer to the PEHeaderBehaviors complex type for more information about specific behaviors.

The set of files whose headers should be evaluated may be identified with either a complete filepath or a path and filename. Only one of these options may be selected.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

---------------------------------------------------------
The PrinterEffectiveRightsBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the pritnereffectiverights_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='true')  
      - 'include_group' defines whether the group trustee name should be included in the object when the object is defined by a group trustee name. For example, the intent of an object defined by a group trustee name might be to retrieve all the user trustee names that are members of the group, but not the group trustee name itself.  
    * - resolve_group (Deprecated)  
      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='false')  
      - The 'resolve_group' behavior defines whether an object set defined by a group SID should be resolved to return a set that contains all the user SIDs that are a member of that group. Note that all child groups should also be resolved any valid domain users that are members of the group should also be included. The intent of this behavior is to end up with a list of all individual users from that system that make up the group once everything has been resolved.

Last write time can be queried on any key, with hives being classified as a type of key. When collecting only information about a registry hive or key the last write time will be the time the key or any of its entries were modified. When collecting only information about a registry name the last write time will be the time the containing key was modified. Thus when collecting information about a registry name, the last write time does not correlate directly to the specified name. See the RegQueryInfoKey function lpftLastWriteTime.  
    * - type  
      - win-def:EntityStateRegistryTypeType (0..1)

    * - value  
      - oval-def:EntityStateAnySimpleType (0..1)  
      - The value entity allows a test to be written against the value held within the specified registry key(s). If the value being tested is of type REG_BINARY, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'binary' and the data represented by the value entity should follow the xsd:hexBinary form. (each binary octet is encoded as two hex digits) If the value being tested is of type REG_DWORD, REG_QWORD, REG_DWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN, REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN, and REG_QWORD_LITTLE_ENDIAN then the datatype attribute should be set to 'int' and the value entity should represent the data as an unsigned integer. DWORD and QWORD values represnt unsigned 32-bit and 64-bit integers, respectively. If the value being tested is of type REG_EXPAND_SZ, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'string' and the pre-expanded string should be represented by the value entity. If the value being tested is of type REG_MULTI_SZ, then only a single string (one of the multiple strings) should be tested using the value entity with the datatype attribute set to 'string'. In order to test multiple values, multiple OVAL registry tests should be used. If the specified registry key is of type REG_SZ, then the datatype should be 'string' and the value entity should be a copy of the string. If the value being tested is of type REG_LINK, then the datatype attribute should be set to 'string' and the null-terminated Unicode string should be represented by the value entity.Note that if the intent is to test a version number held in the registry (as a reg_sz) then instead of setting the datatype to 'string', the datatype can be set to 'version'. This allows tools performing the evaluation to know how to perform less than and greater than operations correctly.

      - Desc.  
    * - max_depth  
      - Restriction of xsd:integer (optional *default*='-1')  
      - 'max_depth' defines the maximum depth of recursion to perform when a recurse_direction is specified. A value of '0' is equivalent to no recursion, '1' means to step only one directory level up/down, and so on. The default value is '-1' meaning no limitation. For a 'max_depth' of -1 or any value of 1 or more the starting key must be considered in the recursive search.  
Note that the default recurse_direction behavior is 'none' so even though max_depth specifies no limitation by default, the recurse_direction behavior turns recursion off.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the key entity.  
    * - recurse_direction  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='none') ('none', 'up', 'down')  
      - 'recurse_direction' defines the direction, either 'up' to parent keys, or 'down' into child keys to recursively search for registry keys. When recursing up or down, one is limited by the max_depth behavior. Note that it is not an error if max_depth specifies a certain level of recursion and that level does not exist. Recursing should only go as deep as available. The default value is 'none' for no recursion.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the key entity.  
    * - windows_view  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='64_bit') ('32_bit', '64_bit')  
      - 64-bit versions of Windows provide an alternate file system and registry views to 32-bit applications. This behavior allows the OVAL Object to specify which view should be examined. This behavior only applies to 64-bit Windows, and must not be applied on other platforms.  
Note that the values have the following meaning: '64_bit' - Indicates that the 64-bit view on 64-bit Windows operating systems must be examined. On a 32-bit system, the Object must be evaluated without applying the behavior. '32_bit' - Indicates that the 32-bit view must be examined. On a 32-bit system, the Object must be evaluated without applying the behavior. It is recommended that the corresponding 'windows_view' entity be set on the OVAL Items that are collected when this behavior is used to distinguish between the OVAL Items that are collected in the 32-bit or 64-bit views.

The regkeyauditedpermissions53_object element is used by a registry key audited permissions test to define the objects used to evalutate against the specified state. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic.

A regkeyauditedpermissions53_object is defined as a combination of a Windows registry key and trustee name. The hive and key elements represents the registry key to be evaluated while the trustee name represents the account (SID) to check audited permissions of. If multiple keys or SIDs are matched by either reference, then each possible combination of registry key and SID is a matching registry key audited permissions object. In addition, a number of behaviors may be provided that help guide the collection of objects. Please refer to the RegkeyAuditPermissions53Behaviors complex type for more information about specific behaviors.

The regkeyauditedpermissions_object element is used by a registry key audited permissions test to define the objects used to evalutate against the specified state. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic.

A regkeyauditedpermissions_object is defined as a combination of a Windows registry key and trustee name. The hive and key elements represents the registry key to be evaluated while the trustee name represents the account (SID) to check audited permissions of. If multiple keys or SIDs are matched by either reference, then each possible combination of file and SID is a matching file audited permissions object. In addition, a number of behaviors may be provided that help guide the collection of objects. Please refer to the RegkeyAuditPermissionsBehaviors complex type for more information about specific behaviors.

.. _RegkeyEffectiveRights53Behaviors:  
  
== RegkeyEffectiveRights53Behaviors ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
The RegkeyEffectiveRights53Behaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the registrykeyeffectiverights53_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

The RegkeyEffectiveRights53Behaviors extend the win-def:RegistryBehaviors and therefore include the behaviors defined by that type.

    * - resolve_group (Deprecated)  
      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='false')  
      - The 'resolve_group' behavior defines whether an object set defined by a group SID should be resolved to return a set that contains all the user SIDs that are a member of that group. Note that all child groups should also be resolved any valid domain users that are members of the group should also be included. The intent of this behavior is to end up with a list of all individual users from that system that make up the group once everything has been resolved.

Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

      - 'include_group' defines whether the group trustee sid should be included in the object when the object is defined by a group trustee sid. For example, the intent of an object defined by a group trustee sid might be to retrieve all the user trustee sids that are members of the group, but not the group trustee sid itself.  
    * - resolve_group (Deprecated)  
      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='false')  
      - The 'resolve_group' behavior defines whether an object set defined by a group SID should be resolved to return a set that contains all the user SIDs that are a member of that group. Note that all child groups should also be resolved any valid domain users that are members of the group should also be included. The intent of this behavior is to end up with a list of all individual users from that system that make up the group once everything has been resolved.

      - 'include_group' defines whether the group SID should be included in the object when the object is defined by a group SID. For example, the intent of an object defined by a group SID might be to retrieve all the user SIDs that are a member of the group, but not the group SID itself.  
    * - resolve_group  
      - xsd:boolean (optional *default*='false')  
      - The 'resolve_group' behavior defines whether an object set defined by a group SID should be resolved to return a set that contains all the user SIDs that are a member of that group. Note that all child groups should also be resolved any valid domain users that are members of the group should also be included. The intent of this behavior is to end up with a list of all individual users from that system that make up the group once everything has been resolved.

.. _sid_sid_test:  
  
< sid_sid_test >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The sid_sid_test is used to check properties associated with the specified SID. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a sid_sid_object and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

Note that this sid_sid test was added in version 5.4 as a temporary fix. There is a need within the community to identify things like users and groups by both the name and the SID. For version 6 of OVAL, work is underway for a better solution to the problem, but for now, a second test was added to satisfy the need.

The user_test is used to check information about Windows users. When the user_test collects the users on the system, it should only include the local and built-in user accounts and not domain user accounts. However, it is important to note that domain user accounts can still be looked up. Also, note that the collection of groups, for which a user is a member, is not recursive. The only groups that will be collected are those for which the user is a direct member. For example, if a user is a member of group A, and group A is a member of group B, the only group that will be collected is group A. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information.

When the user_sid_test collects the user SIDs on the system, it should only include the local and built-in user SIDs and not domain user SIDs. However, it is important to note that domain user SIDs can still be looked up. Also, note that the collection of groups, for which a user is a member, is not recursive. The only groups that will be collected are those for which the user is a direct member. For example, if a user is a member of group A, and group A is a member of group B, the only group that will be collected is group A. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references a user_sid_object and the optional state element specifies the metadata to check.

      - The search_criteria entity specifies a string to examine the search criteria that was used to generate the object set. Note that since this entity is part of the state, it is not used to determine the object set, but rather is used to test the search criteria that was actually used.  
    * - update_id  
      - oval-def:EntityStateStringType (0..1)  
      - The update_id enity specifies a string that represents a revision-independent identifier of an update. This information is part of the IUpdateIdentity interface that is part of the result of the IUpdateSearcher interface's Search method.  
  
.. _WuaUpdateSearcherBehaviors:  
  
== WuaUpdateSearcherBehaviors ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
The WuaUpdateSearcherBehaviors complex type defines behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of the wuaupdatesearcher_object being specified. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.
