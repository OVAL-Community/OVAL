Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: Linux Definition  
=========================================================
* Schema: Linux Definition  
* Version: 5.11.1:1.2  
* Release Date: 11/30/2016 09:00:00 AM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the Linux specific tests found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each test is an extension of the standard test element defined in the Core Definition Schema. Through extension, each test inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL tests. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at http://oval.cisecurity.org.

.. _apparmorstatus_test:  
  
< apparmorstatus_test >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The AppArmor Status Test is used to check properties representing the counts of profiles and processes as per the results of the "apparmor_status" or "aa-status" command. It extends the standard TestType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the TestType description for more information. The required object element references an apparmorstatus_object and the optional state element specifies the data to check.

.. _apparmorstatus_object:  
  
< apparmorstatus_object >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The apparmorstatus_object element is used by an apparmorstatus test to define the different information about the current AppArmor polciy. There is actually only one object relating to AppArmor Status and this is the system as a whole. Therefore, there are no child entities defined. Any OVAL Test written to check AppArmor status will reference the same apparmorstatus_object which is basically an empty object element.

.. _apparmorstatus_state:  
  
< apparmorstatus_state >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The AppArmor Status Item displays various information about the current AppArmor policy. This item maps the counts of profiles and processes as per the results of the "apparmor_status" or "aa-status" command. Please refer to the individual elements in the schema for more details about what each represents.

      - This is the package name to check.  
    * - arch  
      - oval-def:EntityStateStringType (0..1)  
      - This is the architecture for which the RPM was built, like : i386, ppc, sparc, noarch. In the case of an apache rpm named httpd-2.0.40-21.11.4.i686.rpm, this value would be i686.  
    * - epoch  
      - Restriction of oval-def:EntityStateAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)  
      - This is the epoch number of the RPM, this is used as a kludge for version-release comparisons where the vendor has done some kind of re-numbering or version forking. For a null epoch (or '(none)' as returned by rpm) the string '(none)' should be used.. This number is not revealed by a normal query of the RPM's information -- you must use a formatted rpm query command to gather this data from the command line, like so. For an already-installed RPM: rpm -q --qf '%{EPOCH}\n' installed_rpm For an RPM file that has not been installed: rpm -qp --qf '%{EPOCH}\n' rpm_file  
    * - release  
      - Restriction of oval-def:EntityStateAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)  
      - This is the release number of the build, changed by the vendor/builder.  
    * - version  
      - Restriction of oval-def:EntityStateAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)  
      - This is the version number of the build. In the case of an apache rpm named httpd-2.0.40-21.11.4.i686.rpm, this value would be 2.0.40.  
    * - evr  
      - oval-def:EntityStateEVRStringType (0..1)  
      - This represents the epoch, version, and release fields as a single version string. It has the form "EPOCH:VERSION-RELEASE". Note that a null epoch (or '(none)' as returned by rpm) is equivalent to '0' and would hence have the form 0:VERSION-RELEASE. Comparisons involving this datatype should follow the algorithm of librpm's rpmvercmp() function.  
    * - signature_keyid  
      - oval-def:EntityStateStringType (0..1)  
      - This field contains the 64-bit PGP key ID that the RPM issuer (generally the original operating system vendor) uses to sign the key. Note that the value should NOT contain a hyphen to separate the higher 32-bits from the lower 32-bits. It should simply be a 16 character hex string. PGP is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the RPM being considered. Software packages and patches are signed cryptographically to allow administrators to allay concerns that the distribution mechanism has been compromised, whether that mechanism is web site, FTP server, or even a mirror controlled by a hostile party. OVAL uses this field most of all to confirm that the package installed on the system is that shipped by the vendor, since comparing package version numbers against patch announcements is only programmatically valid if the installed package is known to contain the patched code.  
    * - extended_name  
      - oval-def:EntityStateStringType (0..1)  
      - This represents the name, epoch, version, release, and architecture fields as a single version string. It has the form "NAME-EPOCH:VERSION-RELEASE.ARCHITECTURE". Note that a null epoch (or '(none)' as returned by rpm) is equivalent to '0' and would hence have the form NAME-0:VERSION-RELEASE.ARCHITECTURE. The 'gpg-pubkey' virtual package on RedHat and CentOS should use the string '(none)' for the architecture to construct the extended_name.  
    * - filepath  
      - oval-def:EntityStateStringType (0..1)  
      - This field contains the absolute path of a file or directory included in the rpm.

.. _FileBehaviors:  
  
== FileBehaviors ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
The FileBehaviors complex type defines a number of behaviors that allow a more detailed definition of a set of files or file related items to collect. Note that using these behaviors may result in some unique results. For example, a double negative type condition might be created where an object entity says include everything except a specific item, but a behavior is used that might then add that item back in.

It is important to note that the 'max_depth' and 'recurse_direction' attributes of the 'behaviors' element do not apply to the 'filepath' element, only to the 'path' and 'filename' elements. This is because the 'filepath' element represents an absolute path to a particular file and it is not possible to recurse over a file.

Attributes  
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. list-table:: Attributes  
    :header-rows: 1  
  
    * - Attribute  
      - Type  
      - Desc.  
    * - max_depth  
      - Restriction of xsd:integer (optional *default*='-1')  
      - 'max_depth' defines the maximum depth of recursion to perform when a recurse_direction is specified. A value of '0' is equivalent to no recursion, '1' means to step only one directory level up/down, and so on. The default value is '-1' meaning no limitation. For a 'max_depth' of -1 or any value of 1 or more the starting directory must be considered in the recursive search.  
Note that the default recurse_direction behavior is 'none' so even though max_depth specifies no limitation by default, the recurse_direction behavior turns recursion off.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
    * - recurse  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='symlinks and directories') ('directories', 'symlinks', 'symlinks and directories')  
      - 'recurse' defines how to recurse into the path entity, in other words what to follow during recursion. Options include symlinks, directories, or both. Note that a max-depth other than 0 has to be specified for recursion to take place and for this attribute to mean anything. Also note that this behavior does not apply to Windows systems since they do not support symbolic links. On Windows systems the 'recurse' behavior is always equivalent to directories.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
    * - recurse_direction  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='none') ('none', 'up', 'down')  
      - 'recurse_direction' defines the direction to recurse, either 'up' to parent directories, or 'down' into child directories. The default value is 'none' for no recursion.  
Note that this behavior only applies with the equality operation on the path entity.  
    * - recurse_file_system  
      - Restriction of xsd:string (optional *default*='all') ('all', 'local', 'defined')  
      - 'recurse_file_system' defines the file system limitation of any searching and applies to all operations as specified on the path or filepath entity. The value of 'local' limits the search scope to local file systems (as opposed to file systems mounted from an external system). The value of 'defined' keeps any recursion within the file system that the file_object (path+filename or filepath) has specified. For example, if the path specified was "/", you would search only the filesystem mounted there, not other filesystems mounted to descendant paths. The value of 'defined' only applies when an equality operation is used for searching because the path or filepath entity must explicitly define a file system. The default value is 'all' meaning to search all available file systems for data collection.  
Note that in most cases it is recommended that the value of 'local' be used to ensure that file system searching is limited to only the local file systems. Searching 'all' file systems may have performance implications.  
  
  
.. _EntityStateRpmVerifyResultType:  
  
== EntityStateRpmVerifyResultType ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
The EntityStateRpmVerifyResultType complex type restricts a string value to the set of possible outcomes of checking an attribute of a file included in an RPM against the actual value of that attribute in the RPM database. The empty string is also allowed to support the empty element associated with variable references. Note that when using pattern matches and variables care must be taken to ensure that the regular expression and variable values align with the enumerated values.

    * - fail  
      - | 'fail' indicates that the test failed and is equivalent to a bold charcter in the test result string reported by the rpm -V command.

.. _EntityStateProtocolType:  
  
== EntityStateProtocolType ==  
---------------------------------------------------------
The EntityStateProtocolType complex type restricts a string value to the set of physical layer protocols used by AF_PACKET sockets. The empty string is also allowed to support the empty element associated with variable references. Note that when using pattern matches and variables care must be taken to ensure that the regular expression and variable values align with the enumerated values.
