Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: Junos Definition  
=========================================================
* Schema: Junos Definition  
* Version: 5.11.1:1.1  
* Release Date: 11/30/2016 09:00:00 AM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the Junos-specific tests found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each test is an extension of the standard test element defined in the Core Definition Schema. Through extension, each test inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL tests. Each test is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core Definition Schema is not outlined here.

This schema was originally developed by David Solin at jOVAL.org. The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at http://oval.cisecurity.org.

.. _xml_config_object:  
  
< xml_config_object >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The xml_config_object element is used by an XML config test to define the object to be evaluated. For the most part this object checks for existence and is used without a state comparision. Each object extends the standard ObjectType as defined in the oval-definitions-schema and one should refer to the ObjectType description for more information. The common set element allows complex objects to be created using filters and set logic. Again, please refer to the description of the set element in the oval-definitions-schema.

    * - xpath  
      - oval-def:EntityObjectStringType (1..1)  
      - An XPATH 1.0 expression that should be evaluated against the XML configuration file. Any valid XPATH 1.0 statement is usable with one exception, at most one field may be identified in the XPATH. This is because the value_of element in the data section is only designed to work against a single field. The only valid operator for xpath is equals since there is an infinite number of possible xpaths and determinining all those that do not equal a given xpath would be impossible.

.. _xml_config_state:
