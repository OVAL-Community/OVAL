Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language: Linux System Characteristics  
=========================================================
* Schema: Linux System Characteristics  
* Version: 5.11.1:1.2  
* Release Date: 11/30/2016 09:00:00 AM

The following is a description of the elements, types, and attributes that compose the Linux specific system characteristic items found in Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language (OVAL). Each item is an extension of the standard item element defined in the Core System Characteristic Schema. Through extension, each item inherits a set of elements and attributes that are shared amongst all OVAL Items. Each item is described in detail and should provide the information necessary to understand what each element and attribute represents. This document is intended for developers and assumes some familiarity with XML. A high level description of the interaction between the different tests and their relationship to the Core System Characteristic Schema is not outlined here.

The OVAL Schema is maintained by the OVAL Community. For more information, including how to get involved in the project and how to submit change requests, please visit the OVAL website at http://oval.cisecurity.org.

.. _apparmorstatus_item:  
  
< apparmorstatus_item >  
---------------------------------------------------------
The AppArmor Status Item displays various information about the current AppArmor policy. This item maps the counts of profiles and processes as per the results of the "apparmor_status" or "aa-status" command. Each item extends the standard ItemType as defined in the oval-system-characteristics-schema and one should refer to the ItemType description for more information.

A complete source of additional mount options is the f_flag field of 'struct statvfs'. See statvfs(2). /etc/fstab may have additional mount options, but it need not contain all mounted filesystems, so it MUST NOT be relied upon. Implementers MUST be sure to get all mount options in some way.

      - This is the pakage name to check.  
    * - arch  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - This is the architecture for which the RPM was built, like : i386, ppc, sparc, noarch. In the case of an apache rpm named httpd-2.0.40-21.11.4.i686.rpm, this value would be i686.  
    * - epoch  
      - Restriction of oval-sc:EntityItemAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)  
      - This is the epoch number of the RPM, this is used as a kludge for version-release comparisons where the vendor has done some kind of re-numbering or version forking. For a null epoch (or '(none)' as returned by rpm) the string '(none)' should be used. This number is not revealed by a normal query of the RPM's information -- you must use a formatted rpm query command to gather this data from the command line, like so. For an already-installed RPM: rpm -q --qf '%{EPOCH}\n' installed_rpm For an RPM file that has not been installed: rpm -qp --qf '%{EPOCH}\n' rpm_file  
    * - release  
      - Restriction of oval-sc:EntityItemAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)  
      - This is the release number of the build.  
    * - version  
      - Restriction of oval-sc:EntityItemAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)  
      - This is the version number of the build, changed by the vendor/builder. In the case of an apache rpm named httpd-2.0.40-21.11.4.i686.rpm, this value would be 2.0.40.  
    * - evr  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemEVRStringType (0..1)  
      - This represents the epoch, version, and release fields as a single version string. It has the form "EPOCH:VERSION-RELEASE". Note that a null epoch (or '(none)' as returned by rpm) is equivalent to '0' and would hence have the form 0:VERSION-RELEASE.  
    * - signature_keyid  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - This field contains the PGP key ID that the RPM issuer (generally the original operating system vendor) uses to sign the key. PGP is used to verify the authenticity and integrity of the RPM being considered. Software packages and patches are signed cryptographically to allow administrators to allay concerns that the distribution mechanism has been compromised, whether that mechanism is web site, FTP server, or even a mirror controlled by a hostile party. OVAL uses this field most of all to confirm that the package installed on the system is that shipped by the vendor, since comparing package version numbers against patch announcements is only programmatically valid if the installed package is known to contain the patched code.  
    * - extended_name  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - This represents the name, epoch, version, release, and architecture fields as a single version string. It has the form "NAME-EPOCH:VERSION-RELEASE.ARCHITECTURE". Note that a null epoch (or '(none)' as returned by rpm) is equivalent to '0' and would hence have the form NAME-0:VERSION-RELEASE.ARCHITECTURE. The 'gpg-pubkey' virtual package on RedHat and CentOS should use the string '(none)' for the architecture to construct the extended_name.  
    * - filepath  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..unbounded)  
      - This field contains the absolute path of a file or directory included in the rpm.

.. _rpmverify_item:  
  
< rpmverify_item > (Deprecated)  
---------------------------------------------------------
**Deprecation Info**:  
* Deprecated As Of Version 5.10  
* Reason: Replaced by the rpmverifyfile_item and rpmverifypackage_item. The rpmverify_item was split into two items to distinguish between the verification of the files in an rpm and the verification of an rpm as a whole. By making this distinction, content authoring is simplified and information is no longer duplicated across items. See the rpmverifyfile_item and rpmverifypackage_item.  
* Comment: This state has been deprecated and will be removed in version 6.0 of the language.  
  
This item stores rpm verification results similar to what is produced by the rpm -V command.

    * - Child Elements  
      - Type (MinOccurs..MaxOccurs)  
      - Desc.  
    * - name  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - This is the package name to check.  
    * - epoch  
      - Restriction of oval-sc:EntityItemAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)  
      - This is the epoch number of the RPM, this is used as a kludge for version-release comparisons where the vendor has done some kind of re-numbering or version forking. For a null epoch (or '(none)' as returned by rpm) the string '(none)' should be used.. This number is not revealed by a normal query of the RPM's information -- you must use a formatted rpm query command to gather this data from the command line, like so. For an already-installed RPM: rpm -q --qf '%{EPOCH}\n' installed_rpm For an RPM file that has not been installed: rpm -qp --qf '%{EPOCH}\n' rpm_file  
    * - version  
      - Restriction of oval-sc:EntityItemAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)  
      - This is the version number of the build. In the case of an apache rpm named httpd-2.0.40-21.11.4.i686.rpm, this value would be 2.0.40.  
    * - release  
      - Restriction of oval-sc:EntityItemAnySimpleType. See schema for details. (0..1)

    * - arch  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - This is the architecture for which the RPM was built, like : i386, ppc, sparc, noarch. In the case of an apache rpm named httpd-2.0.40-21.11.4.i686.rpm, this value would be i686.  
    * - extended_name  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemStringType (0..1)  
      - This represents the name, epoch, version, release, and architecture fields as a single version string. It has the form "NAME-EPOCH:VERSION-RELEASE.ARCHITECTURE". Note that a null epoch (or '(none)' as returned by rpm) is equivalent to '0' and would hence have the form NAME-0:VERSION-RELEASE.ARCHITECTURE.  
    * - dependency_check_passed  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemBoolType (0..1)  
      - The dependency_check_passed entity indicates whether or not the dependency check passed. If the dependency check is not performed, due to the 'nodeps' behavior, this entity must not be collected.  
    * - ~~digest_check_passed~~  
      - ~~oval-sc:EntityItemBoolType (0..1~~)  
      - ~~The digest_check_passed entity indicates whether or not the verification of the package or header digests passed. If the digest check is not performed, due to the 'nodigest' behavior, this entity must not be collected.~~  
    * - verification_script_successful  
      - oval-sc:EntityItemBoolType (0..1)  
      - The verification_script_successful entity indicates whether or not the verification script executed successfully. If the verification script is not executed, due to the 'noscripts' behavior, this entity must not be collected.  
    * - ~~signature_check_passed~~  
      - ~~oval-sc:EntityItemBoolType (0..1~~)
