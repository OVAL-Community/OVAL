Community Organization
======================

Note that requirements langauge used within this section is defined by RFC2119_.

The OVAL Community includes:

* :ref:`community-members`: Responsible for maintaining OVAL and these governance processes by creating issues, reviewing issues, creating change proposals, collaborating on change proposals, reviewing change proposals and generally contributing to this consensus-driven process.
* :ref:`oval-leadership-board`: Steers the OVAL mission and use cases, assists (when needed) with consensus calls, is instrumental in updating design principles, and is responsible for selecting the Official Release(s).
* :ref:`area-supervisors`: An Area Supervisor is responsible for the day-to-day management of its appointed area.
* :ref:`oval-sponsor`: Mainly handles logistics for managing OVAL resources, managing area supervisor appointments, operating the OVAL Repository, and so on.

How the Community Works
-----------------------
The gist of OVAL Community operations is basically that any Community Member can make a proposal about anything OVAL-related at any time, and that proposal follows through our proposal process. Community Members, Area Supervisors, the Sponsor, and the Leadership Board may all play a role in the process as a proposal moves from start to finish.
