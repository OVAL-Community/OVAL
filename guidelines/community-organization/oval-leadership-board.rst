Responsibilities
----------------

Language Governance Responsibilities
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The Leadership Board plays a role in various aspects of the overall language development process.

Language Development
""""""""""""""""""""
In overall language development, the Leadership Board has an important, direct function in providing guiding support to a consensus call, when needed. Such support may be needed when consensus is too difficult for an Area Supervisor to judge. The IETF has published an excellent informational RFC on the subject: `RFC 7282 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7282/>`_.


Update Design Principles
""""""""""""""""""""""""
As proposals to the language are received in the language development process, we may find a need to update the OVAL Design Principles. A specific subprocess has been defined to handle this case, where the Leadership Board plays an important role.

* **Review Proposed Update:** All parties review the proposed update to the design principles
* **Suggest Change:** All parties are able to suggest changes to the proposed update
* **Create Consensus Call:** The leadership board MUST formally call for consensus on the design principle update proposal
* **Address Issue:** When issues are raised during a formal consensus call, the Leadership Board MUST acknowledge and take appropriate action for the raised issue
* **Update Design Principles:** The Leadership board MUST authorize updates to the design principles (another party, i.e. the sponsor, may actually update the design principles artifact)

Appointment
-----------
Members of the Leadership Board are appointed by the Sponsor with guidance being provided by the existing Leadership Board. [#]_ The Sponsor will consider suggestions for Leadership Board appointments from the OVAL Community at large. Such suggestions should be directed to oval@cisecurity.org.

.. rubric: Footnotes

.. [#] OVAL Board members participating during the time MITRE was the OVAL Sponsor have been carried forward as initial members of the Leadership Board.
