# OVAL-Board
This directory is home to information relevant to OVAL Board activities.

## Quarterly meetings
Information relevant to quarterly meetings (starting with the 2020 Q3 meeting) are contained in `quarterly-meetings`. A directory is created for each meeting (with the format `YYYY-MM-DD`), and relevant artifacts are placed in that directory, including an agenda.

Adding items to an agenda is as easy as letting us know via the OVAL Board mailing list, or creating an issue in this repository with the label `OVAL-Board Agenda Item`.
