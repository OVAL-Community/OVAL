# Area Supervisors Meeting: June 7, 2021

## Agenda
- Question on SSHD test: Adding FileBehaviors?
	- In that case you could end up with a nil filename, and search a directory, which isnt correct in this case.
	- Because of that, we would just want a filepath, and can use a File object to do searching and select `filepath`
	- So NO to FileBehaviors, only add `filepath`
- If we're doing that, why isnt that just a TextFileContent check?
	- Because you can add the `-f` flag to the `sshd` command to query properties
- Added Palo Alto: Reviewers?
	- Thanks @solind
- Added AIX `lssec`: Reviewers?
	- Thanks @solind

## Participants
- Bill M
- Jarrett Lu

## Notes
Still need to add the `version` to the AWS tests

### SSHD
Can use the `sshd` command with a filepath to query (`-f` flag in conjunction with `-T`)

### NetworkFirewall
Proposer asked to close the PR; still needs more work
OK to close.

### Auditdline
The process goes through the ".d" directory to compile the audit rules file
Watson to ask Steve Grubb on how you can load separate config files from other directories.

## For Next Time
- Bill to add `version` to AWS tests, for real this time
- Bill to add `filepath` to SSHD test
- Bill to close the NetworkFirewall proposal and PR
- Watson to check with Steve on loading configs for auditd
