- Jarrett Lu

## Notes

Adam wants to get the AWS and SSHD proposals into stable by August
This is ambitious, we might be able to get them into the development branch

Keep up and keep pressing on AWS/SSHD/macOS to get implementations
Maybe spin up a machine in AWS to ensure tools get the same results

### AWS
BILL TODO: Add API version number to the schema

### SSHD
BILL TODO: Add the filepath entity to the object

### Auditdline & NetworkFirewall
Firewall test needs some work, maybe some separation due to different firewall implementations
As long as the tests are considered "well designed", the implementations will appear

### Other Notes
Some issues in the Mac OS schema; some minOccurs are not set to 0; David Solin to fix them up
Low-hanging fruit is PR 113 (website documentation)

## For Next Time

- API version number added to AWS
- Filepath element added to SSHD
- minOccurs="0" to macOS schema
